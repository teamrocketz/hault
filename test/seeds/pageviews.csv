Ad blockers are gaining in popularity and with Chrome's 50+ percent browser market share and auto-updating ability the Chrome ad blocker would instantly become the most widely used solution out there. This would give Google control over the ad-blocking market the ad industry as a whole and even over its competitors which offer many of the 'unacceptable ad' formats the coalition is targeting. Third-party ad-blocking solutions like Adblock Plus actually charge websites money to display ads to Adblock Plus users and Google is a member of this whitelist-for-cash program. Running its own ad-blocking program might shut out or at least reduce the fees the company pays to third parties like Adblock Plus."
